# CNN
Peer-graded Assignment: Week 3: CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project

# To run the code first check if you have all the libraries in your environment
For example,
- pip install numpy
- pip install pandas
- pip install tensorflow

# The data used is in the folder Data
The data is so big and for that reason it is not here in GitHub, but is free in:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data

# The result is the file:
Submission.csv

# Source code 
NPL.ipynb

## Repository Structure
Considerations:
Using 5k records consume 40GB of ram 
The variable resolution changes the scope of the models
